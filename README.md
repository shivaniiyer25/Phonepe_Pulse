# Phonepe_Pulse
The objective of this project is to create a solution capable of retrieving, modifying, and presenting data sourced from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository.
Acquiring Data:
Retrieve data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository by utilizing scripting techniques for cloning the repository and fetching data. Store the acquired data in a suitable format like CSV or JSON.
Data Processing:
Leverage scripting languages like Python and libraries such as Pandas to preprocess and transform the data. Tasks may involve data cleaning, managing missing values, and formatting the data to make it suitable for analysis and visualization.
Database Integration:
Utilize the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to establish a connection with a MySQL database. Insert the transformed data into the database using SQL commands.
Dashboard Development:
Employ Python libraries like Streamlit and Plotly to develop an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's geo map functionalities can be utilized to visually represent the data on a map. Streamlit offers tools to create a user-friendly interface with dropdown options, enabling users to select various data metrics for display.
Data Retrieval:
Utilize the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and retrieve the data into a Pandas dataframe. Utilize the dataframe to dynamically update the dashboard with the latest data.
